By encapsulating related data and methods within a class, we can hide the internal details of how data is stored and processed. Only the necessary information and functionality are exposed to the outside world, while the implementation details remain hidden. This allows for data abstraction by providing a simplified interface for interacting with the data.\n",

By using access modifiers, we can specify which data and methods are accessible from outside the class. For achieving data abstraction, it is common to mark the internal implementation details (such as variables) as private and provide public methods to access and modify the data. This ensures that the external code interacts with the data only through the defined public interface, maintaining abstraction.\n",
